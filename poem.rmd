The letter A is awesome!   
It simply is the best.  
Without an A, you could not get  
an A+ on a test.  
You’d never see an acrobat  
or eat an apple pie.  
You couldn’t be an astronaut  
or kiss your aunt goodbye.  
An antelope would not exist.  
An ape would be unknown.  
You’d never hear a person  
say “Afraid” or “All Alone”.  
The A’s in avocado  
would completely disappear  
and certain words would be forgot  
like “ankle”, “arm”, and “ear”.
